# Raspberry-Pi-Screen ReadMe

This repo provides code to run a background carousel of images and info for the supplied 3D printed case

**3D Printed case**

STL files are available in the STL folder of this repo
The case is designed for an ICE Tower Cooler (or OEM equivalent)

*Print settings*

PLA, 0.3 mm layer height, 3 layer wall thickness, top and bottom

**Hardware setup**

The case will fit a 1.8" TFT SPI screen (128x160, ST7735 driver chip).  
These are readily available for a few pounds on eBay (around Â£2.50+postage)

Here is the wiring diagram to connect the screen to the Raspberry Pi:

**Code for running screen**

A single python script and images folder will run a carousel of images on the screen.

The python script uses Adafruit's rgb display drivers that can be installed on your Raspberry Pi with the following commands in a terminal window:

~~~~
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-rgb-display
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install ttf-dejavu
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
